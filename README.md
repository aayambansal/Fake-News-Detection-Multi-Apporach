## Project Overview

This project is an AI-driven system for real-time detection and mitigation of fake news using multi-source verification. The system performs instantaneous cross-verification of news sources, analyzes linguistic patterns, compares content with trusted databases, and assesses the credibility of sources in real-time. The repository is designed to detect fake news across multiple platforms like social media and web applications.

## Key Features

1. **Real-Time Detection**:
   - Detects fake news in real-time from social media and news articles using multi-source verification.
   - Achieves processing latency of less than 1.5 seconds per item.

2. **Linguistic Analysis**:
   - Extracts various linguistic features, such as sentiment, readability, and named entity recognition.

3. **Multi-Source Verification**:
   - Cross-references claims against multiple reputable sources for better accuracy.

4. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Combines Gradient Boosting and BERT models for accurate fake news detection.
   - Accuracy: 89% on the LIAR dataset.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aayambansal/Fake-News-Detection-Multi-Apporach.git
cd Fake-News-Detection-Multi-Apporach

2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the necessary libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Web Application
To start the Flask web application for testing fake news detection, run:

python main.py

4. Streaming Real-Time Twitter Data
To start streaming and processing tweets in real-time, use the following command:

python social_media/twitter_streamer.py

Components
1. Preprocessing
File: data/preprocess.py
Cleans and normalizes raw text data by removing HTML tags, special characters, URLs, etc.

2. Linguistic Feature Extraction
File: features/linguistic_features.py
Extracts important linguistic features, including sentiment, readability, and named entities from the news content.

3. Source Credibility
File: credibility/source_credibility.py
Assesses the credibility of news sources based on historical accuracy and reputation.

4. Fake News Classification Model
File: models/fake_news_model.py
An ensemble model combining BERT and Gradient Boosting models is used for final classification.
Note: BERT is fine-tuned on the LIAR dataset for improved detection performance.

5. Real-Time Processing
File: realtime/processor.py
Processes real-time data feeds (like tweets) and applies fake news detection on the fly.

6. Twitter Streaming
File: social_media/twitter_streamer.py
Uses the Twitter API to fetch tweets in real-time and applies fake news detection algorithms.

Dataset
The system was trained and evaluated using the LIAR dataset, a collection of labeled news articles with six veracity classes (e.g., true, false, pants-on-fire).

Metrics
Accuracy: 89%
Processing Time: ~1.3 seconds per item
Throughput: 750 tweets/second
Future Work
Multi-modal analysis to include images and videos.
Cross-lingual capabilities to support news detection in different languages.
Further development of explainable AI components for transparent decision-making.
